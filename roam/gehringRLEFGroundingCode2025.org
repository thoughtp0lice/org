#+title: RLEF: Grounding Code LLMs in Execution Feedback with Reinforcement Learning - Gehring, Jonas and Zheng, Kunhao and Copet, Jade and Mella, Vegard and Carbonneaux, Quentin and Cohen, Taco and Synnaeve, Gabriel

* Improve the efficiency of write and debug loop
- write and debug may not be as efficient as just resample
- see write and debug as a MDP
- Use PPO to train LLM to be better at write and debug
