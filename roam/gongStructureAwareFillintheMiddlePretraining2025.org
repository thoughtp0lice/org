#+title: Structure-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Pretraining for Code - Gong, Linyuan and Cheung, Alvin and Elhoushi, Mostafa and Wang, Sida

- Use for fill in the middle pre-training
- Instead of masking a random span, mask based on AST.
  - Single-Node Masking.
    - selects a single AST node to mask
    - AST node with probability proportional to its size
    - ignore nodes that represent keywords or punctuation
  - Aligned Span Masking
    1. Sample a character span with uniformly random endpoints [start, end]
    2. Find the lowest AST subtree T that contains this character span.
    3. Let T1 , T2 , . . . , Tn be the direct children of T , the subtree selected in the previous step. We now select a continuous sequence of these children, to form the middle part. We choose the sequence that has the largest character-level Intersection over Union (IoU) with the original random span [start, end].
