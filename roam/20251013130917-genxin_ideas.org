Here's a set of ideas i have for gengxin

* Use RL to finetune LLM to generate small edits
- [[id:9daa4bc9-099d-4101-a5b6-9233aaca7a95][RL LLM Finetune]]
- Use edit distance or overlap as reward

* Constrained generation to make small edits
- [[id:27279185-2be2-402b-a314-9e583cc0ff6c][Contrained LLM Generation]]
* Fill-in-the-Middle [cite:@gongStructureAwareFillintheMiddlePretraining2025][cite:@bavarianEfficientTrainingLanguage2022][cite:@gongEvaluationLLMsSyntaxAware2024]

* Generating Diff Directly
- Known that diff may not not work as well as generating whole file: [[https://aider.chat/docs/benchmarks.html][Aider GPT Benchmark]]
- Claude generate whole file instead of diff so context is easier to manage
