#+title: Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents - Xia, Chunqiu Steven and Deng, Yinlin and Dunn, Soren and Zhang, Lingming

Instead of letting LLM make decisions to use tools, make plans, etc. Have a predefined pipeline that
1. localize suspicious files
2. format files into skeleton with only necessary information
3. Write patches to make repair
4. Write tests. Then test and select patches
