- Study of internal Google AI Tool
  - Developers often prompt the LLM again after rejecting or accepting the code edit
  - Developers do not like optimizing prompt after initial failure
    - 7% of requests are repeat of previous prompt
    - Edit of prompts are usually small edit
- Code Edit Data
  - Getting ground truth edit data by
    1. Getting user submitted feedback
    2. use code after 30 minutes
- Common cause of code edit failure
  - not being specific
  - missing an operationalization plan
  - faulty scope
  - missing code base context or intent
- Automatic User Prompt Enhancement
  - Given original prompt, llm code edit, and code context
  - Prompt LLM to fill missing information
