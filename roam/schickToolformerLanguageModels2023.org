#+title: Toolformer: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Use Tools - Schick, Timo and Dwivedi-Yu, Jane and DessiÌ€, Roberto and Raileanu, Roberta and Lomeli, Maria and Zettlemoyer, Luke and Cancedda, Nicola and Scialom, Thomas

Use [[id:374d0242-6d95-4b4f-adaa-1f7211b39f59][LLM]] to teach itself how to do [[id:1682914e-fc81-45cd-ad30-b6c56c25e9e3][LLM Tool Using]].

* Mehtod
1. Ask LLM to annotate data to add tool calling location
2. Call the tools and add the result
3. Filter out tools that don't improve the loss compare to no tool calling or no tool execution
4. Finetune the model using the new data
